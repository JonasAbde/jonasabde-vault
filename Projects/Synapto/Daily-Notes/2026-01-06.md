**Commit [2c16c6d]:**
```
Configuration: Reduce IDE noise and scope linting + Session Documentation

Core Changes:
- .vscode/settings.json: Exclude archives/** from watchers, search, Python analysis; limit ESLint to frontend
- .markdownlint.json: Disable overly strict style rules (MD022, MD032, MD031, MD040, MD060, MD036, MD026, MD024); ignore archives
- agent-work/by-session/2026-01-06/SESSION_LOG.md: Complete session documentation

Impact:
- TypeScript: 0 errors (verified with npx tsc --noEmit)
- Frontend: All 3 modified files clean
- Flutter: 233/233 tests passing
- Backend: 579 passed, 17 failed, 20 errors (up from 528; other agent working)
- VS Code Problems noise: 8k+ → ~5-10 real issues (-95%)

Documentation:
- Captured real test baseline and security blockers
- Coordination system implemented and validated
- Root cleaned (65 → 9 files), 44 docs properly archived
- Prevention system active (CI/CD health check, agent checklist)
